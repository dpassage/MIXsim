The MIX machine itself was defined by Donald Knuth in his work "The Art
of Computer Programming".  He uses the machine, and the assembly language
that goes with it, to illustrate the algorithms in the book.

I'm working from Volume 2, "Seminumerical Algorithms", of the first edition,
published in 1969 [Knuth1969V2].  I understand that there's an assembler for 
MIX written in MIX in another volume, but this is the only one I have to hand.

Non-trivial test programs in the "testdata" directory are identified by
author, with references below.  Given the nature of this work, I hope that
the authors of the test programs will allow me to continure to distribute them;
if not, please contact me above.
